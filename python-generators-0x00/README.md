# python-generators-0x00

This project focuses on building Python generators for **efficient data streaming** and **lazy evaluation** with **MySQL databases**. It’s part of the ALX ProDev backend specialization.

Generators are a powerful way to handle large datasets without overwhelming system memory.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to create Python generators
- Stream data from a MySQL database one row at a time
- Perform batch processing using generators
- Implement lazy pagination using offset/limit
- Use generators to compute memory-efficient aggregates
